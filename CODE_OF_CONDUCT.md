# Code of Conduct

## 1. Purpose

## 2. Expected Behavior

*   Attempt collaboration before conflict.
*   Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
*   Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders (ZUNJAE/KonoSekai) if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

## 3. Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered unacceptable within our community:

*   **Asking for Dark Mode**

*   Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.

## 4. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

**If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate (!), up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community and application without warning.**

## 5. Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible through Reddit (/u/ZUNJAE) or Discord (through the official AnYme server)
