## Things you should know

* **AnYme  requires no app permission**. So it can't look at your private files and send them to a server
* You need at least Android 4.4

* AnYme uses **HTTPS** when connecting to MAL, tho when creating a MAL account, I recommend you pick a password you do not use anywhere else!
