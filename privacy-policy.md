<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

TL;DR: AnYme uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/) Crash Reporting and Cloud Messaging to improve its services. It's used to track very basic user data, like what Android version you have, what happened before the app crashed etc. Other than tracking device info. If you don't want to be tracked, add Firebase to your AdBlocker. 

Thanks!
